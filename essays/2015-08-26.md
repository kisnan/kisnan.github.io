Initially, I was studying Civil Engineering, and I found I was interest on one of my class requirement ICS 111 that instructing basic ideas about JavaScript. I spent a lot of time to learn how to put my imagination on my code. I enjoyed to doing so, and my friend who just graduate from MIS told me MIS is more like a combination of coding and business. So thatâ€™s how I get start to this class.
