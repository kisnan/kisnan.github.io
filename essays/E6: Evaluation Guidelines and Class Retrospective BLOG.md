Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
	I try to build a e-commerce website for selling camera, with different combination. User can go to the product selection page to put in a quantity for the item that they want, and they could add the item to their shopping cart. User can register an account to finish purchase and it would generate a receipt and send an email to the user.
Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
I have having a difficult time to work on working on the session part of the assignment, and I am concerning if I couldn’t complete my assignment at this moment. I think the understanding of the last lab cookie and session was extremely difficult.
Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
I think I am proud of building my first and second assignment under professor Port assistant. I earn a lot of ownership when I was working on my assignment. I building my own website was more difficult than I thought.
Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I think my system is incomplete is something that make me least happy about, and I wish I could finish it even the semester is over. Also, I think I have really bad redundancy on my code because of really relied on copy other codes.
How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
I think deploy the session and cookie into the assignment makes it really difficult to complete, and after a several workshop, I still have really bad understanding regarding to my code.
When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I will try to go online to search if there is similar error for my issue, and if I couldn’t fix the bug, I will go ahead to get help from professor.
Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
I think my user interface is decent, and it look similar to a professional website, other than that, having the login and registration page make me feel I am on the right track.
Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
I think understanding of the assignment was extremely difficult, and I have to have really good understand of the lecture in order to apply the material to my assignment. I think WOD was really helpful regarding to the assignment. However, at the end of the semester, we are not require to do WOD to apply what we have learn to the class
What did you learn from doing this assignment?
Critical thinking is very important, and 90% of the time that working on the assignment was about apply the understanding to the code. Its really important to understand code in order to apply them to the assignment.
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
I think I would spend more time on working on the session, and I think if I have better understanding of session, I would do a better job to complete my website.
Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I think 40% of the time is think about how to get thing work and how should I apply logic to the code, and 10 percent of the time was actually writing code on my VS code, the 50 percent of the time was debugging. 
Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
I am the only person working on my assignment 3, and I think I have try my best to get the best output in general. However, I think I would get really stressful when thing does not work as I want.
