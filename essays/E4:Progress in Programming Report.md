As I have done my Assignment2, I think its milestone for me to summarize how am I doing with ITM 352. I think Assignment2 is like a higher ramp to access the server in order to post my user input to my database. I thought server is something reserver for back-end programmer, and I wouldn’t need to learn that. However, after I complete my lan, I found that server is very clear and we just need to clearly program what kind of input that we need, and what kind of output that we need to response. I spend a lot of time to review my lab, and try to understand each single line of the code to apply them to my assignment2. I think learning from other people code can accelerate my learning progress.

I think that most difficult part on the Assignment2 was applying function to the server in order to check the user’s input. I think I was less estimated about how much work and effort was needed to apply on the programming. First of all, we need to declare a function regarding the response and request. Secondly, I need to apply the function to the server, and test it ensure the server serving my function appropriately. Lastly, I need to double check with the redundancy on my code, see if there is some thing that is not needed on my code. Moreover, connecting what we have learn from the lab and apply them to the assignment is significant because I think we need to have logic in order to programing the  codes. I always tell myself that computer is very stupid, and I would need to clearly program each line. I would need to understand why do I need this one rather than the other one. 

What something that I have learn from working on the Assignment2 was the micro service, one night, I went to the office hour in order to get help regarding to do type on checking for current existing user. I thought I could do a if statement for checking the user name that was type-in is valid or not. However, I think I was too naive on that because we need to have the server to access the user.json in order to get the existed user information. I eventually went to the office hour, and get help from professor Port. 

In conclusion, I think I have a lot of fun working on the Assignment2 because I earned a lot of ownership by completing my Assignment2. Programming means to be time-consuming, but I believe taking advantage from the flexibility of ITM352 could help me learn more about programing and debugging. I am looking forward to complete my assignment3 and wrap up my Spring, 2021.
