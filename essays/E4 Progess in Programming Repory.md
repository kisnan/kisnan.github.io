	Finally complete my assignment1 and I think it is time to summarized who am I doing on my Assignment1. I think Assignment1 finally combine what we have learn from the first half of the semester, and apply these idea to a e-commerce website. At I have complete my invoice 4 and smartphone product WOD, I simply thought I would just need to combine them together in order to get my website works. However, I think I was to naive to think that, and I made a huge mistake that simply copying code from my previous assignment and expect that would work for me. Eventually, my website does not work, and I need to have office hour in order to fix my code.
	I think office hour is really important for this class because we can have one-on-one session with the professor in order to solve problems. I have to admit that I am not a outgoing person, this is my first time to go office hour specially online class. It was really worth it to go to the office hour because Professor Port know code so well, and he could immediately find out my problem and provide me a solution. I do understand coding should not just simply copying code and apply the code to the other thing, but I still thing my previous code is very helpful for me to get inspiration from. 
	In conclusion, I think working on my Assignment1 was really tough because we are first time to put everything we have learn together and apply it to the website. However, I think the office hour was really helpful for resolving technical issue problems.
