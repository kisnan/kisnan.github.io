Invoice 1 WOD seem is a more challenge WOD in my opinion, and I think Invoice 1 require a really good understanding on these recent chapter. I was confuse about how to get started at the beginning because I am not doing good on these several section. However, I have done the invoice 1 under the instructions. I am still improving my timer, and try to done it within 15 minute. There are some experience that I can share.
	
My thought for starting this assignment was get start by coding all the item ahead, and I think that could help me save some time when I am working on the rest of the assignment. Next step, I try to use JavaScript to code a formula in order to complete the calculation part on the chart. I think the JavaScript need to be careful because I have alway missed something on my code. After the calculation, we need to use the formatting that was given to format the number. After we paste the formatting code, we need to edit it appropriately with correct items. Tax, sub total, and the total should be organized, and print on where I expected them to.
	
I am glad that I have JavaScript, and I could clear remember those command line. However, there are some thing that I think I could done better on my last attempt. For example, I should have double check for my code spelling. I realized that If I want to code faster, I will have more opportunity for misspell for the variable. Also, I was confuse for how to code a chart on HTML, and I realized the we can go inspect a the website that was given, and copy the chartâ€™s code to my WOD. However, I do think memorizing the the code of the chart could benefit me in the future. After this WOD, I have learn a lot from the outside resources, to see how to use a better method to code a chart. 
	
In conclusion, I think coding a chart, specially on this WOD, learning how to use shortcut can motivate myself on coding. HTML and JavaScript are very interesting for learning. Since this time, I was considered cheating via copy the chart from the instruction, I will definitely learn how to code indecently on my next WOD
